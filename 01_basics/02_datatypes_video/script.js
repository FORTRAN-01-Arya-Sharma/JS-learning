// "typeof null returns 'object' due to a bug in the original implementation of JavaScript. Internally, values were tagged using bits, and null was represented as all zeroes â€” which got misinterpreted as the object type. Although it's a mistake, it's kept for backward compatibility. So, we use value === null to reliably check for null."
