- Js is a single-threaded language, meaning it can only execute one piece of code at a time.
- When a JavaScript program runs, it starts with the first line of code and executes it sequentially.
-Js always hava an runtime environment, which is a place where the code is executed.
- The JavaScript runtime environment includes the JavaScript engine, which interprets and executes the code.

‚ùóExecution context:‚ùó
- the js code is executed in two phases
  1.Memory creation phase:-
    - In this phase, the JavaScript engine creates a global execution context and sets up the memory for variables and functions.
    - Variables are initialized with `undefined`, and functions are hoisted to the top of their scope.
  2.Code execution phase:
    - In this phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code line by line.
    - It evaluates expressions, executes functions, and updates variable values as needed.


‚ùóHow Js Code actually works ‚ùó    
1 we have global execution context and function execution context
2 which is allocated in this
3 Memory creation phase
    -undefined will be assigned to variables
    -functions will be have definition
4 Code execution phase
 - the value will be assigned to variables
- Functions will be executed
- The JavaScript engine uses a call stack to keep track of function calls and execution contexts.


-everytime the function is called, a new execution context is created and pushed onto the call stack.
- When the function completes, its execution context is popped off the stack, and control returns to the previous context.
- This process continues until the entire program has been executed.



‚úÖ So, How Does Node.js Provide That Environment?
# 1. Uses V8 JavaScript Engine (from Chrome)
This is the engine that actually executes JavaScript code.

Written in C++

Translates JS code into fast machine code

Same engine used by Google Chrome

# 2. Adds C++ APIs & Libraries Around V8
Node.js wraps V8 with its own C++ codebase and adds:

Capability	How Node.js Gives It
File system access	Through the built-in fs module
Networking	Using modules like http, net
Timers	Custom implementation of setTimeout, etc.
Console I/O	Built-in support for console.log(), etc.
Modules	Uses CommonJS module system (require())

So, it gives JavaScript extra powers that the browser doesn't.

# 3. Event Loop (Node‚Äôs Core Superpower)
Node.js is built around an event loop that handles asynchronous tasks efficiently.

Helps run tasks without blocking the main thread

Enables high-performance web servers

Example: read file, handle HTTP request, or wait 2 seconds ‚Äî all without freezing the program.

# 4. Built-in Modules
Node.js provides many built-in modules:

Module	Purpose
fs	File system (read/write files)
http	Create web servers
os	Access system information
events	Handle custom events
path	Work with file paths

These are not available in the browser, but Node.js gives them to you.

‚ùì Can JavaScript run alone?
‚úÖ Yes and No ‚Äî Depends on what you mean by "alone" 
yes with the help of an an environment like node.js



üì¶ What is CommonJS?
CommonJS (CJS) is a module system used in Node.js to import and export code between files.

It lets you write modular code by splitting your code into different files and using require() and module.exports.



<!-- If we want to run JavaScript in our desktop or local environment (outside the browser), we need a runtime like Node.js. Node.js includes the V8 engine (to execute JavaScript) and a collection of built-in modules (like fs, http, etc.) that allow JavaScript to interact with the system, files, and network ‚Äî things browsers don‚Äôt allow directly.‚Äù -->


<!--
üîç So is Node.js just a bundle of packages?
Not exactly ‚Äî it's more than that:

‚úÖ Node.js includes packages/modules (like fs, http, etc.)

‚úÖ It embeds the V8 engine (the JavaScript engine from Chrome)

‚úÖ It adds a custom runtime environment with an event loop, non-blocking I/O, etc. -->





üöÄ 1. What is the V8 Engine?
V8 is the JavaScript engine developed by Google.

It is written in C++ and is used inside the Chrome browser and Node.js.

Its job is to:

Parse your JavaScript code.

Compile it to machine code (not interpret line by line ‚Äî it compiles for speed!).

Execute it very fast.

Think of it as the brain that understands and runs your JavaScript ‚Äî whether inside Chrome or Node.js.

üîß Why is it called V8?
The name V8 is inspired by car engines ‚Äî like a "V8 car engine" which is known for being powerful and fast.

So Google gave it that name as a metaphor:

‚ÄúThis is a super-fast JavaScript engine üöóüí®.‚Äù


# üß† ‚ÄúJavaScript doesn‚Äôt run on its own ‚Äî Node.js doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòrun‚Äô JavaScript, it just provides the environment in which JavaScript can run. Like humans need oxygen, JavaScript needs Node.js (or the browser) to breathe.‚Äù


<!-- The name Node.js comes from the idea that each instance acts as a lightweight "node" in a network, designed to build scalable, event-driven applications using JavaScript. -->


‚úÖ Interview Answer ‚Äì What is an API?

# "An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It acts as a bridge between the client and the server. For example, when we use a mobile app to check the weather, the app sends a request to a web API, which returns the weather data from the server. APIs are widely used in web development, app integration, and connecting services like payment gateways or social logins."

‚úÖ Interview Answer ‚Äì What is ReactJS?

# "ReactJS is a JavaScript library used for building fast, interactive, and reusable user interfaces, mainly for single-page applications. It enhances HTML by allowing us to use JavaScript functions and logic directly within the UI using JSX (JavaScript XML). This makes frontend development more efficient and modular. With features like components, hooks, and a virtual DOM, React simplifies the process of building responsive and dynamic web applications using less code."


MongoDB is the database itself. It is used to store data in a flexible, JSON-like format (called BSON).

Mongoose is a library (ODM) that runs in Node.js, and helps you interact with MongoDB easily using JavaScript. It lets you define data schemas, add validation, and perform CRUD operations in a structured way.


MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format (BSON).

It supports JavaScript-style syntax for queries (like filters, conditions), but it‚Äôs not made to run full JavaScript applications.

It does not use V8 ‚Äî MongoDB has its own internal query engine.

Node.js, on the other hand, uses the V8 engine and is the actual environment where JavaScript runs outside the browser.
