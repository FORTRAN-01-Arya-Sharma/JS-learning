<!-- 📝 Brief Summary Note:
This JavaScript code uses XMLHttpRequest to make an API call to GitHub for user hiteshchoudhary. It:

Sets up a GET request.

Listens for the request’s progress with onreadystatechange.

Once the request is complete (readyState === 4), it:

Parses the JSON response.

Logs the response type and the number of followers to the console. -->

<!-- ❗NOTES❗  -->
<!-- to easily use and understand API we use json formatter -->
 <!-- https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/ --> 
<!-- console.log is not the part of core javascript, it's just a debugging tool its a browser feature/dev tool this inject the runtime of js -->
 <!-- nodejs is an implementation of javascript the v8 engine -->
<!-- The V8 engine is the JavaScript engine developed by Google for the Chrome browser. It is written in C++ and is responsible for executing JavaScript code. -->


<!-- 🧩How Node.js Uses V8:
When you write JavaScript in Node.js, it is passed to the V8 engine.

V8 parses it, compiles it into machine code, and executes it on your computer's CPU.

Node.js adds APIs (like fs, http, etc.) to allow JavaScript to interact with the system (these are not part of V8, but part of Node.js itself). -->

<!-- d8 console.css the console.log comes from here -->
